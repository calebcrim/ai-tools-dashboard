### 2. Test Locally with Netlify

3. Get your Measurement ID (starts with G-)
4. Save it for Netlify environment variables

## 📦 Deploy to Netlify

### Option A: Deploy Preview First (Recommended)
```bash
# Create a deploy preview
netlify deploy

# You'll get a preview URL like:
# https://1234567890--crimintel-ai.netlify.app
# Test everything works before going live
```

### Option B: Direct to Production
```bash
# If confident, deploy directly
netlify deploy --prod
```

1. Go to Netlify Dashboard → crimintel.ai
2. Settings → Environment Variables
3. Add:
   - `GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` = `G-YOUR-ID-HERE`
   - Any other API keys you need

### 2. Generate Full Sitemap
```bash
# After deployment, visit:
https://crimintel.ai/sitemap-generator.html

# Download the generated sitemap
# Upload to your site root
```

### 3. Submit to Google Search Console
1. Go to [Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
2. Add crimintel.ai as a property

## 📊 Verify Analytics

### In GA4 Real-Time View, you should see:
1. **Page views** when navigating
2. **Custom events**:
   - `view_tool` - When clicking tool cards
   - `search` - When using search
   - `use_filter` - When filtering
   - `click` (outbound) - When clicking to tool sites

### Check User Journey:
- Look for `user_journey_update` events
- Monitor `session_end` events
- Check engagement scoring

## 🔐 Continue with Phase 3 (Security)

### Tell Claude Code:
```
Great work on Phases 0-2! Now please implement Phase 3 (Security) from security-implementation.md:
- Input sanitization for all user inputs
- XSS prevention
- CSRF protection
- Rate limiting
- Security monitoring

Remember to skip security headers since netlify.toml handles those.
```

### Expected Security Features:
1. **Input Sanitizer** - Clean all search/filter inputs
2. **XSS Prevention** - Safe rendering of dynamic content
3. **CSRF Tokens** - For any form submissions
4. **Rate Limiter** - Prevent abuse
5. **Security Monitor** - Log suspicious activities

## 🎯 Phase 4 Features (After Security)

### Tell Claude Code:
```
Now implement Phase 4 features from implementation-checklist.md:
- Lazy loading for tool cards
- Search autocomplete with debouncing
- Recently viewed tools
- Export comparisons to PDF
- Email signup with Netlify Forms
```

## 📈 Success Metrics to Monitor

### Week 1:
- [ ] Analytics data flowing to GA4

- [ ] Pages indexed in Google
- [ ] Load time under 2 seconds
- [ ] Zero console errors

### Month 1:
