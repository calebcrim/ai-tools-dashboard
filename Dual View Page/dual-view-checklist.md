## Notes for Implementation

1. **Prioritization**: Focus on performance first, then features
2. **Testing**: Test with real data throughout development
3. **Feedback**: Get user feedback early and often
4. **Iteration**: Plan for post-launch improvements
5. **Documentation**: Document as you build

## Risk Mitigation

- **Performance degradation**: Implement monitoring before issues arise
- **Browser compatibility**: Test early on all target browsers
- **Data inconsistency**: Validate all data transformations
- **User confusion**: Provide clear onboarding and help
- **Technical debt**: Refactor as you go, don't accumulate

This checklist should be treated as a living document and updated as the project progresses.
