# Dual View Enhancement Overview

## Current State Analysis
- **Original Design**: Built for 100+ tools with basic data
- **Current Dataset**: 317 tools with extensive metadata
- **Challenge**: Performance, data density, and user experience at scale

## Enhancement Goals
1. **Performance**: Handle 317+ tools without lag
2. **Data Richness**: Display new fields intelligently
3. **Scalability**: Design for 500+ tools
4. **User Experience**: Maintain clarity despite increased complexity

## Key Improvements Needed
