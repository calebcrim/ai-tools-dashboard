Microsoft’s Bing Chat and Bing Image Creator also incorporate DALL-E 3 for image 
generation. For direct use in custom applications, OpenAI has introduced an API 
endpoint for DALL-E 3 (currently in beta as of late 2024), so developers can 
programmatically generate images. This API integration allows DALL-E 3 to be 
added to design tools, content management systems, or any pipeline via REST
