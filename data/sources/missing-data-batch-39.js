      feature_breakdown: "Tome has completely pivoted from presentation tool to AI sales assistant (now called Lightfield CRM). Core features include: 1) AI-powered account research providing 360Â° view of target accounts from web and internal data, 2) Strategic initiative identification and key decision maker mapping, 3) Personalized outreach crafting that aligns value propositions with account needs, 4) Automated meeting preparation with timely briefings and discovery questions, 5) CRM data integration with external market insights. The platform is trained on user playbooks and CRM data to identify strategic initiatives and growth indicators.",
      pricing_model: "Not publicly disclosed. The tool requires contacting sales for custom pricing. Multiple sources confirm no pricing information is available publicly. Based on enterprise focus and CRM functionality, likely follows enterprise SaaS model with custom quotes based on team size and features needed.",
      pros_cons_limitations: "Pros: Automates time-consuming account research, provides comprehensive target account intelligence, integrates internal CRM data with external market data, designed specifically for enterprise sales teams, offers personalized outreach recommendations. Cons: No public pricing transparency, primarily focused on enterprise sales teams (may not suit smaller businesses), requires CRM integration setup, relatively new pivot means limited track record in sales automation space. Limitations: Enterprise-focused solution, requires significant CRM data to be effective, may have learning curve for teams transitioning from previous tools.",
      integration_potential: "Integrates with popular CRM platforms including Salesforce, HubSpot, and Pipedrive. Connects to email providers for outbound campaigns. API access for custom integrations. Designed to work seamlessly with existing sales tech stacks. Supports data export in multiple formats for offline analysis and integration into financial models.",
      learning_curve: "Medium to High - While the interface is described as intuitive with natural language queries, the tool requires significant setup including CRM integration, data training, and team onboarding. Enterprise sales teams need to configure account targeting parameters and train the AI on their specific playbooks and methodologies. Initial setup involves connecting multiple data sources and customizing automation workflows.",
      geo_regulatory_limitations: "Not publicly disclosed. As an enterprise B2B sales tool, likely available globally but may have data residency requirements. Being part of the broader CRM/sales technology ecosystem, likely complies with standard business software regulations (GDPR, SOC2) but specific certifications not disclosed.",
      case_studies: "Limited public case studies due to recent pivot. The platform claims to help sales teams 'break into large accounts' and 'automate account research' but specific customer names, ROI metrics, or performance improvements are not publicly disclosed. Given the enterprise focus, case studies likely exist but are kept confidential for competitive reasons.",
