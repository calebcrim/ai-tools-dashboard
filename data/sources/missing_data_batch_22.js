      pros_cons_limitations: "Pros: Intuitive no-code interface makes algorithmic trading accessible to non-programmers; AI-assisted strategy creation significantly reduces development time; integrated brokerage functionality enables seamless execution; strong backtesting capabilities; active community for strategy sharing. Cons: Limited to predefined strategy blocks and templates; backtesting may not reflect real market conditions with slippage and fees; requires understanding of trading concepts to avoid overfitting; relatively new platform with limited track record. Limitations: Currently integrated only with Alpaca brokerage; strategies constrained by available building blocks; advanced customization requires deeper trading knowledge.",
