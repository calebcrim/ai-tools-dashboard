# Fix Navigation URL Inconsistency

## Problem Description
The website has inconsistent navigation URL patterns:
- **Most navigation buttons**: `[mywebsite].ai/[page]`
- **One problematic button**: `[mywebsite].ai/js/components/[page]/index.html`

This inconsistency needs to be resolved so all navigation follows the same pattern.

## Task for Claude Code

Please help me standardize the navigation URLs across the website. Here's what needs to be done:

### 1. Find the Problematic Navigation Link
Search the codebase for navigation links that follow the pattern `/js/components/*/index.html`. Look in:
- Navigation component files (likely in components/Navigation, components/Header, or similar)
- Any menu configuration files
- JavaScript files that handle routing
- HTML files with navigation elements

### 2. Identify the Root Cause
Determine why this one navigation item has a different URL structure:
- Is it pointing to a static HTML file in the components directory?
- Is there a routing configuration issue?
- Is this a legacy link that wasn't updated?

### 3. Implement the Fix

**Option A: If it's a simple link update**
- Change the problematic link from `/js/components/[page]/index.html` to `/[page]`
- Ensure the route `/[page]` is properly configured in your routing system

**Option B: If it requires routing configuration**
- Add a redirect rule from `/js/components/[page]/index.html` to `/[page]`
- Or configure the routing to handle `/[page]` and serve the appropriate content

**Option C: If the page structure needs reorganization**
- Move the content from `/js/components/[page]/index.html` to the proper location
- Update the build/deployment configuration if needed
- Update the navigation link to use the standard pattern

### 4. Verify the Fix
After making changes:
1. Test all navigation links to ensure they work correctly
2. Check that the previously problematic link now follows the standard pattern
3. Ensure no 404 errors occur
4. Verify the page content displays correctly at the new URL

## Additional Context Questions
When examining the code, please also check:
- What framework/library is being used for routing (React Router, Vue Router, etc.)?
- Are there any other navigation inconsistencies?
- Is there a central navigation configuration file that should be updated?

## Expected Outcome
All navigation buttons should follow the consistent pattern: `[mywebsite].ai/[page]`
